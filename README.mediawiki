= ari-backup =

ari-backup is a lightweight wrapper around
[http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/ rdiff-backup]. The goal is to provide a
way to manage many rdiff-backup ''jobs'' consistently and easily with features
like:
* centralzed configuration
* support for backing up local and remote hosts
* configurable job parallelization
* ability to run arbitrary commands locally or remotely before and/or after backup jobs (something especially handy for preparing databases pre-backup)
* logging to syslog

The framework can be extended to support more complex backup configurations.
We currently include extensions that add support for backing up from LVM
snapshots and backing up to ZFS datasets.

This application is lightweight thanks mostly to leveraging common system
tools to provide most of the facility necessary to run a backup system.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron cron] is used to schedule the backup jobs,
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs xargs] is used to optionally run jobs in
parallel, [http://man.cx/run-parts(8) run-parts] is used to execute individual
backup jobs, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_shell ssh] is used for
authentication and secure data transport.

== Audience ==

This README and the ari-backup documentation expect that the reader has a
basic understanding of Linux, file system semantics, how to install a system
package, and how to install a Python package. The typical audience for this
software is the system administrator that wants to backup several systems with
rdiff-backup.

ari-backup was developed on and written for Linux. But there have been reports
of its use on Windows using [http://www.cygwin.com/ cygwin].

== Getting Started ==

Before you install ari-backup, consider installing the following packages from
your Linux distribution.
* python-yaml
* rdiff-backup

ari-backup requires [http://pyyaml.org/ PyYAML] which is not a pure Python
library, so you may prefer providing that dependency with a system package. In
almost all cases, you'll need rdiff-backup installed to do anything meaningful
with ari-backup.  It is also recommended that you also install '''ssh''' if
you somehow don't already have it.

To install the ari_backup package, run this as '''root''':
<pre>
pip install git+git://github.com/jpwoodbu/ari-backup.git
</pre>

Before you can execute a backup job there are a few files and directories that
need to be setup. At this time, the configuration file for ari-backup is
always read from ''/etc/ari-backup/ari-backup.conf.yaml''. For this demo put
this into the ''ari-backup.conf.yaml'' file:
<pre>
backup_store_path: /backup-store
</pre>
Now create the ''/backup-store'' directory.

Our demo will use the most basic example of a backup job. Our job will backup
our ''/music'' directory to ''/backup-store/my_backup''. Put the following into
a file named ''ari-backup-local-demo'':
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ari_backup import ARIBackup

backup = ARIBackup(label='my_backup', source_hostname='localhost')
backup.include_dir_list.append('/music')
backup.run_backup()
</pre>

Make ''ari-backup-local-demo'' executable and run it. Make sure the user you're
using to execute this script has the permission to read the
''/etc/ari-backup/ari-backup.conf.yaml'' file, to read the ''/music'' directory
and has permission to write to the ''/backup-store/my_backup'' directory. If
all goes well, you should see no output to the console. But take a look at your
syslog and you might see lines like this:
<pre>
Nov 17 23:21:56 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] started
Nov 17 23:21:56 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] processing pre-job hooks...
Nov 17 23:21:56 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] data backup started...
Nov 17 23:21:59 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] data backup complete
Nov 17 23:21:59 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] processing post-job hooks...
Nov 17 23:21:59 morbo ARIBackup (my_backup) [INFO] stopped
</pre>

Your ''/backup-store'' directory should now have a ''my_backup'' directory.
And inside that directory you should see a mirror of your ''/music/'' directory
as well as a ''rdiff-backup-data'' directory. The ''rdiff-backup-data'' is
where rdiff-backup stores its own data like the reverse increments,
statistics, and file metadata.

=== Backing up Remote Hosts ===

For a more exciting demo, let's backup a remote host. We'll be using ssh to
authenticate to the remote host and public key authentication is the only
method supported by ari-backup. Be sure to have your keys setup for both the
user that will run ari-backup and the user that we'll use to connect to the
remote host. For this demo, we're going to use the user '''backups'''.

The remote system requires very little setup. Once you've got your SSH key
installed, the only other step is to install rdiff-backup. ari-backup does not
need to be installed on the remote system. Isn't that great!

Make sure that the user that's running your backup script has the remote
host's host key in its known_hosts file. The best way to ensure that it is, is
to test your public key authentication works by logging in to the remote system
manally.

We'll need to add the remote_user setting to our
''/etc/ari-backup/ari-backup.conf.yaml'' file. It should now look like:
<pre>
backup_store_path: /backup-store
remote_user: backups
</pre>

Let's assume that your remote host is named kif. Make a new backup job file
named ''ari-backup-remote-demo'' with this content:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ari_backup import ARIBackup

backup = ARIBackup(label='kif_backup', source_hostname='kif')
backup.include_dir_list.append('/music')
backup.run_backup()
</pre>

Make ''ari-backup-remote-demo'' executable and run it. Again, no output to the
console means everthing worked. Check the syslog and your
''/backup-store/kif_backup'' directory to see the results. Once you've got
your ssh keys setup, the only thing different about remote backups is the
value you put in the source_hostname parameter.

== Using ari-backup with cron ==

See ''include/cron/ari-backup'' for an example script you can use with cron.
By default, this script will look for backup jobs in
''/etc/ari-backup/jobs.d''. And by default, this script will only execute one
backup job at a time. You can edit the '''JOBS_DIR''' and
'''CONCURRENT_JOBS''' variables in the script to tweak those settings to
taste.

To put this altogether with an example, let's use the two backup job scripts
you made from before, ''ari-backup-local-demo'' and ''ari-backup-remote-demo''.
Place them into the ''/etc/ari-backup/jobs.d'' directory. Now copy
''include/cron/ari-backup'' to ''/etc/cron.daily'' (or an equivalent directory
on your system). You can now wait for cron to run the script in
''/etc/cron.daily'', or better yet, execute it yourself to test it out.

You can again look at your syslog to see that the backups ran. But you'll
also notice that when running our cron script you will actually get some
console output as it reports how long the entire selection of jobs took to
run. You may see something like
this:
<pre>
real    3m44.318s
user    0m45.595s
sys     0m8.253s
</pre>

If you have cron setup to email you when there's output like this, then you'll
have a handy (or annoying) email reporting whether your backups ran
successfully each time.

Be sure that the names of your backup job scripts are compatible with what
run-parts expects. See the [http://man.cx/run-parts(8) run-parts man page] for
more on their filename restrictions.

'''Pro tip:''' since run-parts will ignore file names with dots, a simple way
to disable a backup job is to prefix a dot to its filename.

== Extensions ==

TODO write up examples of how to use the LVMBackup and ZFSLVMBackup extensions.

== History and Namesake ==

ari-backup gets its name from the
[http://americanri.com American Research Institute] where it was originally
written in bash. As [http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/ rdiff-backup] was our
software of choice to backup our Linux systems, we needed some sort of
scripting around running rdiff-backup on a schedule. We could write a script
that performed all our backups and just place it in ''/etc/cron.daily'', but
that didn't seem scalable and was especially monolithic since we were backing
up about 50 machines.

We liked the idea of seperate backup scripts for each backup job. In our case,
each job was backing up a host. But we didn't want to overcrowd the
''/etc/cron.daily'' directory. So we put all our backup scripts in their own
directory and put a single file in ''/etc/cron.daily'' that called our backups
using [http://man.cx/run-parts(8) run-parts]. We later cooked in the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs xargs] part that made it easy to run
backup jobs concurrently.

When we started to add the LVM snapshot features we decided that porting it to
Python was going to make working on this project much easier.

In 2011, ARI graciously open-sourced this software.
